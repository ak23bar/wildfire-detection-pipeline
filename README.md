# wildfire-detection-pipeline
Codebase for video preprocessing, optical flow estimation, and model inference using pretrained fire detection models (EfficientNetV2, ResNet18). Originally developed as part of a wildfire detection internship and used in the Vision Mamba project. Designed to be adaptable for other models and video-based classification tasks.
