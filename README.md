# wildfire-detection-pipeline

This codebase supports video preprocessing, optical flow estimation, and inference using pretrained fire detection models (EfficientNetV2, ResNet18). Originally developed during a wildfire detection internship, this pipeline was used in conjunction with the Vision Mamba project for experimental evaluation.

Although Vision Mamba itself is not included, this repository contains adaptable tools for working with video datasets and classification models, and can be extended for use with other architectures or real-time fire detection tasks.
